# kPersistentCheckpoint

A typed safe plugin for [omegga](https://github.com/brickadia-community/omegga).

It's very early on, may be a bugged as hell.

## Install

`omegga install gh:Kodi022/kPersistentCheckpoint`

This plugin relies on Aware's minigameevents plugin to function
https://github.com/mraware/omegga-minigameevents
`omegga install gh:mraware/minigameevents`

## Usage

Every minigame needs a unique name, and if you change the name the saved checkpoints are lost or could use checkpoints from another or old minigame of the same name

furthermore, each team in a minigame needs unique names (if this even works lol)
